# Getting Started
Getting started with open-source may appear a very challenging and overwhelming task at first, but it is, in fact, a fun and rewarding experience.

# Community Led Collaboration
Gaining valuable skills, employers are always seeking, by:
- **Communicating and collaborating** in a team
- **Managing Github and source control** to understand why branching is important along with other key github skills.
- **Learning new stacks and technologies**, providing the opportunity to jump into something new

# How You Benefit
Along with learning new skills, you will also gain experience on projects you can start to list on your Resume/CV. In addition, you will build out your commit history on Github, which employers love! But most importantly, you will learn to work in teams which is one of the most important skills to be a top developer.

# You have 2 options: Join an existing project or create a new project:

## Option 1: Join a project
Joining a project is pretty simple, checkout the [current projects](https://github.com/protocode-community) and find one you would like to participate in. Check out the project README in its repo as it will have a guide on how to get started!

## Option 2: Create a project
If you think you have a new and exciting project or idea the community would love to get involved in, here is the process for getting it listed:
- Reach out to a member of the Staff on our Discord server, with a detailed project brief
- Staff will consider if the project is something that would work well with the community
- A Repository will be created and the project will be announced in #projects channel in our Discord server and featured during upcoming announcements
- If the project evolve into something bigger, we may need to assign extra members, actively maintaining the project for a bigger team

### **Rules**
In order to ensure that students hard work and time are not exploited, there are a couple of rules that will need to be followed for any project:
- The project repo and discussion channels, will be hosted under the protocode Github organization/Discord Server
- The project must use the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

## Current Projects
You can view all current projects [here](https://github.com/protocode-community) or you can view the specific #current-projects channel in our Discord Community that gives you a little more detail on each project.

## Why would I want to contribute?
Here, practicing would be our primary objective, but there are many more pragmatic reasons for contributing to open source projects:

   **1.** To add a new feature / improvement to a project; or to fix an issue with a project.

   **2.** To practice/learn a particular programming language or technology which you are interested in.

   **3.** To build your online presence â€“ highlighting open source contributions relevant to the job makes your resume stand out from the rest.

## Ways to contribute to projects

**1.** **Test:**  Start with testing the code for any bugs, if found raise an issue about it. (Always check first if someone has already raised an issue for the same.)

**2.** **Suggest features:** Look for possible improvements and provide suggestions in the comment section.

**3.** **Design:** Considering the fact that practice is the main objective, try to make little changes on your forked repository and make a pull-request about it. *Commit often and provide appropriate messages to your commits.*

**4.** You can also help in providing proper documentation of the various projects.
